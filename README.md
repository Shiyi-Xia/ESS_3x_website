# 3X: Introduction to R
## Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis

Hello everyone, my name is Winnie Xia. I will be the instructor of _3X: Introduction to R_.
This year, we will introduce base R and _tidyverse_, and leave the introduction to _ggplot2_ to a separate optional R script. The materials are the updated version of the courses from last year taught by [Lorenzo Crippa](https://lorenzo-crippa.github.io), and [Phil Swatton](https://philswatton.github.io).

## Before we start
### Prerequisite
No previous programming and data analysis experience? No problem at all 😏.

However:
- Make sure you download the lastest version of [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com). 
- Take a look at the some [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) that interest you.
- Bring your questions and concerns.

## When we are learning R
Folders
- ***Datasets*** contains data used by R files.
- ***R_files*** contains class R code, exercises, solutions to exercises, and an extra R file to introduce ggplot2.

But we will mainly use this [website](https://raw.githack.com/Shiyi-Xia/ESS_3x_website/main/_site/index.html) during the course.

## When we finish 🎉
### Take-away Notes

- When comes to programming, we often say "there is a steep initial curve 😱, but it becomes progressively easier with time and experience 😎.
- These resources 📚might be useful for you 😌:
   - If you would like to make some [beautiful tables 📑](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/11/how-to-make-beautiful-tables-in-r/).
   -  If you are interested in making maps 🌏: [tmap](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap).
   -  If you are interested in [text analysis](https://quanteda.io).
   -  [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) is an useful tool.
   -  Keep an eye on the [Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index); or  [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Rstudiotips?style=social)](https://twitter.com/rstudiotips).
